# 💗 DressCode 💗

## About: 
A simple web-based dress up game where users can drag and drop clothes and accessories onto a character. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

WIP: DressCode is my main personal passion project that I came up with my senior year of highschool primarily catered towards a feminine audience who are interested in coding. It will be a fully custom Dress up game that implements and teaches the fundamentals of programming. This project combines my love for fashion, programming, art, and making a difference!
